API Reference
=============

This section documents the public newforms API.

.. warning::
   Newforms uses the convention of marking the names of properties and methods
   which should be considered implementation details with a leading underscore.

   These are publicly accessible, but do not use or rely on these in your own
   code, as they may be changed or be removed without warning in any given
   release.

   If there are some implementation details you think would be a useful addition
   to the public API, `file an Issue on GitHub <https://github.com/insin/newforms/issues>`_.
