# newforms [![travis status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/insin/newforms.png)](http://travis-ci.org/insin/newforms)

An isomorphic JavaScript form-handling library for [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).

(Formerly a direct port of the [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com) framework's `django.forms` library)

## Getting newforms

### Node.js

Newforms can be used on the server, or bundled for the client using an
npm-compatible packaging system such as [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) or
[webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).

```
npm install newforms
```

```javascript
var forms = require('newforms')
```

By default, newforms will be in development mode. To use it in production mode,
set the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to `'production'` when bundling. To
completely remove all development mode code, use a minifier that performs
dead-code elimination, such as [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2).

### Browser bundles

Browser bundles expose newforms as a global `forms` variable and expect to
find a global `React` variable to work with.

[newforms 0.9.0 (development version)](https://github.com/insin/newforms/raw/react/dist/newforms-0.9.0.js)

Uncompressed, with warnings about potential mistakes.

[newforms 0.9.0 (production version)](https://github.com/insin/newforms/raw/react/dist/newforms-0.9.0.min.js)

Compressed version for production.

## Quick Guide

A quick introduction to defining and using newforms Form objects.

### Design your form

The starting point for defining your own forms is `Form.extend()`.

Here's a simple (but incomplete!) definition of a type of Form you've probably
seen dozens of times:

```javascript
var SignupForm = forms.Form.extend({
  username: forms.CharField(),
  email: forms.EmailField(),
  password: forms.CharField({widget: forms.PasswordInput}),
  confirmPassword: forms.CharField({widget: forms.PasswordInput}),
  acceptTerms: forms.BooleanField({required: true})
})
```

A piece of user input data is represented by a `Field`, groups
of related Fields are held in a `Form` and a form input which will
be displayed to the user is represented by a `Widget` Every
Field has a default Widget, which can be overridden.

### Create a Form instance in a React component

Form instances hold the state of a Form's user input and validation results.
Since a Form is managing some state for you, you may wish to keep it in your
component's state.

To let the Form let your component know that the state it manages has changed,
pass it an `onChange` callback:

```javascript
var SignupComponent = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function() {
    return {
      form: new SignupForm({onChange: this.forceUpdate.bind(this)})
    }
  },

  // ...
```

### Rendering a Form instance

Forms provide helpers for rendering labels, user inputs and validation errors
for their fields. They also have convenience rendering methods to get you
started quickly by surrounding these with some basic structure.

At the very least, you must wrap these form-rendered contents in a `<form>`,
provide form controls such as a submit button and hook up handling of form
submission:

```javascript
render: function() {
  return <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        {this.state.form.asTable()}
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <div className="controls">
      <input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
    </div>
  </form>
},

// ...
```

Forms attach event handlers to the inputs they render, so getting user input
data is handled for you.

If you gave your Form an `onChange` callback, it will also automatically
validate user input as it's given and let your component know when to re-render,
to display any resulting state changes (such as new validation errors).

### Handling form submission

The final step in using a Form is validating the entire form when the user
attempts to submit it. Calling its `validate()` method validates every field
in the form with its current user input.

If a Form is valid, it will have a `cleanedData` object containing validated
data, coerced to the appropriate JavaScript data type when appropriate:

```javascript
  propTypes: {
   onSubmitSignup: React.PropTypes.func.isRequired
  },

  onSubmit: function(e) {
    e.preventDefault()

    var isValid = this.state.form.validate()
    if (isValid) {
      this.props.onSubmitSignup(this.state.form.cleanedData)
    }
    else {
      this.forceUpdate()
    }
  }
})
```

### Implementing custom validation

There's an obvious validation not being handled by our form: what if the
passwords don't match?

This is a cross-field validation. To implement custom, cross-field validation
add a `clean()` method to the Form definition:

```javascript
clean: function() {
  if (this.cleanedData.password &&
      this.cleanedData.confirmPassword &&
      this.cleanedData.password != this.cleanedData.confirmPassword) {
    throw forms.ValidationError('Passwords do not match.')
  }
}
```
