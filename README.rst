   :target: http://travis-ci.org/insin/newforms

A JavaScript port of `Django`_'s `form-handling library`_, usable in browsers
and on the server with `Node.js`_, which makes use of `React`_ on both sides.

.. _`Django`: http://www.djangoproject.com
.. _`form-handling library`: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/
.. _`Node.js`: http://nodejs.org
.. _`React`: http://facebook.github.io/react/

Install
=======

Node.js::

   npm install newforms

Browser bundles (all dependencies except React included):

* `newforms.js`_ / `newforms.min.js`_

Browser bundles currently expose newforms as a ``forms`` variable and expect to
find a global ``React`` variable to work with.

Quick Guide
===========

Here's a quick guide to getting started with using a newforms' Form.

* Form constructors are created using ``forms.Form.estend()``.

  This takes an ``Object`` argument defining form fields and any other
  properties for the form's prototype (custom validation methods etc.),
  returning a Form constructor which inherits from ``BaseForm``::

     var ContactForm = forms.Form.extend({
       subject  : forms.CharField({maxLength: 100})
     , message  : forms.CharField()
     , sender   : forms.EmailField()
     , ccMyself : forms.BooleanField({required: false})
     })

* For convenience and compactness, the ``new`` operator is **optional** when
  using newforms' Fields, Widgets and other constructors which are commonly
  used while defining a Form, such as ValidationError -- however ``new`` is
  **not**  automatically optional for the Form and FormSet constructors you
  create::

     var form = new ContactForm({initial: initialData})

* Forms have default convenience rendering methods to get you started quickly,
  which display a label, input widgets and any validation errors for each field
  (however, JSX makes it convenient to write your own custom rendering later)::

     <form ref="contactForm">
       <table>
         <tbody>
           {this.state.form.asTable()}
         </tbody>
       </table>
       <div className="controls">
         <input type="button" value="Submit" onClick={this.onSubmit}/>
       </div>
     </form>

* To bind a form to user data to be validated and cleaned, pass a ``data``
  object::

     var formData = forms.formData(this.refs.contactForm.getDOMNode())
     var form = new ContactForm({data: formData})

     if (form.isValid()) {
       // form.cleanedData now contains validated input data, coerced to the
       // appropraite JavaScript type if necessary.
     }
     else {
       // If the form wasn't valid, its error object will now be populated
       // with field validation errors.
       this.setState({form: form})
     }
