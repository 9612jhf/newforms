Form and field validation
=========================

Form validation happens when the data is cleaned. If you want to customise
this process, there are various places you can change, each one serving a
different purpose. Three types of cleaning methods are run during form
processing. These are normally executed when you call the ``isValid()``
method on a form or you bind new data to the form by calling ``setData()``.
There are other things that can trigger cleaning and validation (calling the
``errors()`` getter or calling ``fullClean()`` directly), but normally they
won't be needed.

In general, any cleaning method can throw a ``ValidationError`` if there is a
problem with the data it is processing, passing the relevant information to
the ``ValidationError`` constructor.

Most validation can be done using `validators`_ - helpers
that can be reused easily. Validators are functions that take a single argument
and throw a ``ValidationError`` on invalid input. Validators are run after the
field's ``toJavaScript`` and ``validate`` methods have been called.

Validation steps and order
==========================

Validation of a Form is split into several steps, which can be customised or
overridden:

* The ``toJavaScript()`` method on a Field is the first step in every
  validation. It coerces the value to the correct datatype and throws a
  ``ValidationError`` if that is not possible. This method accepts the raw
  value from the widget and returns the converted value. For example, a
  ``FloatField`` will turn the data into a JavaScript ``Number`` or throw a
  ``ValidationError``.

* The ``validate()`` method on a Field handles field-specific validation
  that is not suitable for a validator. It takes a value that has been
  coerced to the correct datatype and throws a ``ValidationError`` on any error.
  This method does not return anything and shouldn't alter the value. You
  should override it to handle validation logic that you can't or don't
  want to put in a validator.

* The ``runValidators()`` method on a Field runs all of the field's validators
  and aggregates all the errors into a single ``ValidationError``. You shouldn't
  need to override this method.

* The ``clean()`` method on a Field. This is responsible for running
  ``toJavaScript``, ``validate`` and ``runValidators`` in the correct
  order and propagating their errors. If, at any time, any of the methods
  throws a ``ValidationError``, the validation stops and that error is thrown.
  This method returns the clean data, which is then inserted into the
  ``cleanedData`` object of the form.

* Field-specific cleaning/validation hooks on the Form. If your form includes a
  ``clean<FieldName>()`` (or ``clean_<fieldName>()``) method in its definition,
  it will be called for the field its name matches. This method is not passed
  any parameters. You will need to look up the value of the field in
  ``this.cleanedData`` (it will be  in ``cleanedData`` because the general field
  ``clean()`` method, above, has already cleaned the data once).

  For example, if you wanted to validate that the content of a ``CharField``
  called ``serialNumber`` was unique, implementing ``cleanSerialNumber()`` would
  provide the right place to do this.

  These hooks also offer another chance for custom cleaning/normalizing of data.
  If one needs to make a change to the the cleaned value obtained from
  ``cleanedData``, it should return a modifed value, which will be re-inserted
  into ``cleanedData``.

* The Form ``clean()`` method. This method can perform
  any validation that requires access to multiple fields from the form at
  once. This is where you might put in things to check that if field ``A``
  is supplied, field ``B`` must contain a valid email address and the
  like. This method can return a completely different object if it wishes,
  which will be used as the ``cleanedData``.

  Since the field validation methods have been run by the time ``clean()`` is
  called, you also have access to the form's ``errors()``, which contains all
  the errors thrown by cleaning of individual fields.

  Note that any errors thrown by your ``Form.clean()`` override will not
  be associated with any field in particular. They go into a special
  "field" (called ``__all__``), which you can access via the
  ``nonFieldErrors()`` method if you need to. If you want to attach
  errors to a specific field in the form, you need to call
  :js:func:`BaseForm#addError`.

These methods are run in the order given above, one field at a time. That is,
for each field in the form (in the order they are declared in the form
definition), the ``Field.clean()`` method (or its override) is run, then
``clean<Fieldname>()`` (or ``clean_<fieldName>()``) if defined. Finally, the
``Form.clean()`` method, or its override, is executed whether or not the
previous methods have thrown errors.

Examples of each of these methods are provided below.

As mentioned, any of these methods can throw a ``ValidationError``. For any
field, if the ``Field.clean()`` method throws a ``ValidationError``, any
field-specific cleaning method is not called. However, the cleaning methods
for all remaining fields are still executed.

.. _throwing-validation-error:

Throwing ``ValidationError``
============================

In order to make error messages flexible and easy to override, consider the
following guidelines:

* Provide a descriptive error ``code`` to the constructor when possible:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     forms.ValidationError('Invalid value', {code: 'invalid'})

* Don't coerce variables into the message; use placeholders and the ``params``
  argument of the constructor:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     forms.ValidationError('Invalid value: {value}', {params: {value: '42'}})

Putting it all together:

.. code-block:: javascript

   throw forms.ValidationError('Invalid value: {value)', {
     code: 'invalid'
   , params: {value: '42'}
   })

Following these guidelines is particularly useful to others if you write
reusable forms and form fields.

If you're at the end of the validation chain (i.e. your form's ``clean()``) and
you know you will *never* need to override your error message (or even just...
`because <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8c>`_) you can still opt
for the less verbose:

.. code-block:: javascript

   forns.ValidationError('Invalid value: ' + value)

Throwing multiple errors
------------------------

If you detect multiple errors during a cleaning method and wish to signal all
of them to the form submitter, it is possible to pass a list of errors to the
``ValidationError`` constructor.

It's recommended to pass a list of ``ValidationError`` instances with ``code``\s
and ``params`` but a list of strings will also work:

.. code-block:: javascript

   throw forms.ValidationError([
     forms.ValidationError('Error 1', {code: 'error1'})
   , forms.ValidationError('Error 2', {code: 'error2'})
   ])

   throw forms.ValidationError(['Error 1', 'Error 2'])

Using validation in practice
============================

The previous sections explained how validation works in general for forms.
Since it can sometimes be easier to put things into place by seeing each
feature in use, here are a series of small examples that use each of the
previous features.

.. _validators:

Using validators
----------------

Fields support use of utility functions known as validators. A validator
is a function that takes a value and returns nothing if the value is valid, or
thriws a :js:class:`ValidationError` if not. These can be passed to a field's
constructor, via the field's ``validators`` argument, or defined on the field's
``prototype`` as a ``defaultValidators`` property.

Let's have a look at a basic implementation of newforms' ``SlugField``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var MySlugField = forms.CharField.extend({
     defaultValidators: [forms.validators.validateSlug]
   })

As you can see, a basic ``SlugField`` is just a ``CharField`` with a customised
validator that validates that submitted text obeys some character usage rules.
This can also be done on field definition so:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var field = new MySlugField()

is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var field = forms.CharField({validators: [forms.validators.validateSlug]})

Common cases such as validating against an email or a regular expression can be
handled using existing validators available in newforms. For example,
:js:func:`validateSlug` is a function created by passing a slug-matching
``RegExp`` to the :js:class:`RegexValidator` function factory.

Form field default cleaning
---------------------------

Let's firstly create a custom form field that validates its input is a string
containing comma-separated email addresses:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var MultiEmailField = forms.Field.extend({
     /** Normalise data to a list of strings. */
     toJavaScript: function(value) {
       // Return an empty list if no input was given
       if (this.isEmptyValue(value)) {
         return []
       }
       return value.split(/, ?/g)
     }

     /** Check if value consists only of valid emails. */
   , validate: function(value) {
       // Use the parent's handling of required fields, etc.
       MultiEmailField.__super__.validate.call(this, value)
       value.map(forms.validators.validateEmail)
     }
   })

Let's create a simple ContactForm to demonstrate how you'd use this field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var ContactForm = forms.Form.extend({
     subject: forms.CharField({maxLength: 100})
   , message: forms.CharField()
   , sender: forms.EmailField()
   , recipients: new MultiEmailField()
   , ccMyself: forms.BooleanField({required: false})
   })

Cleaning a specific field attribute
-----------------------------------

Suppose that in our ``ContactForm``, we want to make sure that the
``recipients`` field always contains the address ``"fred@example.com"``. This is
validation that is specific to our form, so we don't want to put it into the
general ``MultiEmailField``. Instead, we write a cleaning function that operates
on the ``recipients`` field, like so:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var ContactForm = forms.Form.extend({
     // Everything as before
     // ...

   , cleanRecipients: function() {
       var recipients = this.cleanedData.recipients
       if (recipients.indexOf('fred@example.com') == -1) {
         throw forms.ValidationError('You have forgotten about Fred!')
       }

       // Returning the cleaned data is optional - if anything is returned,
       // cleanedData will be updated with the new value.
       return recipients
     }
   }

If you return anything from a custom field cleaning function, the form's
``cleanedData`` for the field will be updated with the returned value.

Cleaning and validating fields that depend on each other
--------------------------------------------------------

Form#clean()
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways to report any errors from this step. Probably the most common
method is to display the error at the top of the form. To create such an error,
you can throw a ``ValidationError`` from the ``clean()`` method. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var ContactForm = forms.Form.extend({
     // Everything as before
     // ...

   , clean: function() {
       var cleanedData = ContactForm.__super__.clean.call(this)
       var ccMyself = cleanedData.ccMyself
       var subject = cleanedData.subject

       if (ccMyself && subject) {
         // Only do something if both fields are valid so far
         if (subject.indexOf('help') == -1) {
           throw forms.ValidationError(
             "Did not send for 'help' in the subject despite CC'ing yourself.")
         }
       }
     }
   }

Another approach might involve assigning the error message to one of the fields.
In this case, let's assign an error message to both the "subject" and "ccMyself"
rows in the form display:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var ContactForm = forms.Form.extend({
     // Everything as before
     // ...

   , clean: function() {
       var cleanedData = ContactForm.__super__.clean.call(this)
       var ccMyself = cleanedData.ccMyself
       var subject = cleanedData.subject

       if (ccMyself && subject && subject.indexOf('help') == -1) {
         var message = "Must put 'help' in subject when cc'ing yourself."
         this.addError('ccMyself', message)
         this.addError('subject', message)
       }
     }
   }

The second argument oto ``addError()`` can be a simple string, or preferably
an instance of ``ValidationError``. See :ref:`throwing-validation-error` for
more details. Note that ``addError()`` automatically removes the field
from ``cleanedData``.
