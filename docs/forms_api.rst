``Form``
========

.. js:class:: Form([kwargs])

   Extends :js:class:`BaseForm` and registers :js:func:`DeclarativeFieldsMeta`
   as a mixin to be used to set up Fields when this constructor is extended.

   This is intended intended as the entry point for defining your own forms.

   You can do this using its static ``extend()`` function, which is provided by
   `Concur`_.

   .. js:function:: Form.extend(prototypeProps[, constructorProps])

      Creates a new constructor which inherits from Form.

      :param Object prototypeProps:
         form Fields and other prototype properties for the new form, such as a
         custom constructor and validation methods.

      :param Object constructorProps:
         properties to be set directly on the new constructor function.

.. js:function:: DeclarativeFieldsMeta(prototypeProps[, constructorProps])

   This mixin function is responsible for setting up form fields when a new Form
   constructor is being created.

   It pops any Fields it finds off the form's prototype properties object,
   determines if any forms are also being mixed-in via a ``__mixin__`` property
   and handles inheritance of Fields from any form which is being directly
   extended, such that fields will be given the following order of precedence
   should there be a naming conflict with any of these three sources:

   1. Fields specified in ``prototypeProps``
   2. Fields from a mixed-in form
   3. Fields from the Form being inherited from

   If multiple forms are provided via ``__mixin__``, they will be processed from
   left to right in order of precedence for mixing in fields and prototype
   properties.

   Forms can prevent fields from being inherited or mixed in by adding a
   same-named property to their prototype, which isn't a Field. It's suggested
   that you use ``null`` as the value when shadowing to make this intent more
   explicit.

``BaseForm``
============

.. js:class:: BaseForm([kwargs])

   A collection of Fields that knows how to validate and display itself.

   :param Object kwargs: form options, which are as follows:

   :param Object kwargs.data:
      input form data, where property names are field names. A form with data is
      considered to be "bound" and ready for use validating and coercing the
      given data.

   :param Object kwargs.files:
      input file data.

   :param kwargs.validation:
      .. _ref-form-kwargs-validation:

      Configures form-wide interactive validation when the user makes changes to
      form inputs in the browser. This can be a String, or an Object which
      configures default validation for form inputs.

      If ``'manual'``, validation will not be performed -- you are responsible
      for hooking up validation and using methods such as ``setData()`` and
      ``isValid()`` to perform all validation. This is the default setting.

      If ``'auto'``, text fields will, by default be validated when the
      ``onChange`` event fires, with a 250 millisecond delay from the last user
      input to the validation being performed.

      If an Object is given, it should have the following properties:

      ``event``
         The name of the default event to use to trigger validation. This should
         be in camelCase format, as used by React. For example, if ``'onBlur'``,
         text input validation will be performed when the input loses focus
         after editing.

      ``delay``
         A delay, in milliseconds, to be used to debounce performing of
         validation, to give the user time to enter input without distracting
         them with error messages or other change in how the input's displayed
         while they're still typing.

      If any String but ``'manual'`` or ``'auto'`` is given, it will be used as
      if it were passed as the ``event`` property of an Object.

      For example, passing ``{validation: 'onChange'}`` will cause each form
      inputs to trigger validation as soon as the user makes any change.

      .. versionadded:: 0.6

   :param Boolean kwargs.controlled:
      Configures whether or not the form will render controlled components -
      when using controlled components, you can update the values displayed in
      the form post initial render using ``form.setData()`` or
      ``form.updateData()``

      .. versionadded:: 0.6

   :param Function kwargs.onStateChange:
      .. _ref-form-kwargs-onstatechange:

      If interactive validation is configured for a Form or any of its Fields,
      this callback function **must** be provided, or an Error will be thrown.

      It will be called any time the form's input data or validation state
      changes as the result of user input.

      Typically, this function should at least force React to update the component
      in which the Form is being rendered, to display the latest validation state
      to the user from the last change they made to the form.

      .. versionadded:: 0.6

   :param String kwargs.autoId:
      a template for use when automatically generating ``id`` attributes for
      fields, which should contain a ``{name}`` placeholder for the field name
      -- defaults to ``id_{name}``.

   :param String kwargs.prefix:
      a prefix to be applied to the name of each field in this instance of the
      form - using a prefix allows you to easily work with multiple instances of
      the same Form object in the same HTML ``<form>``, or to safely mix Form
      objects which have fields with the same names.

   :param Object kwargs.initial:
      initial form data, where property names are field names -- if a field's
      value is not specified in ``data``, these values will be used when
      initially rendering field widgets.

   :param Function kwargs.errorConstructor:
      the constructor function to be used when creating error details. Defaults
      to :js:class:`ErrorList`.

   :param String kwargs.labelSuffix:
      a suffix to be used when generating labels in one of the convenience
      methods which renders the entire Form -- defaults to ``':'``.

   :param Boolean kwargs.emptyPermitted:
      if ``true``, the form is allowed to be empty -- defaults to ``false``.

   **Instance Properties**

   Form options documented in ``kwargs`` above are all set as instance
   properties.

   The following instance properties are also available:

   .. js:attribute:: form.fields

      Form fields for this instance of the form.

      Since a particular instance might want to alter its fields based on data
      passed to its constructor, fields given as part of the form definition
      are deep-copied into ``fields`` every time a new instance is created.

      Instances should only ever modify ``fields``.

      .. Note::

         ``fields`` does not exist until the ``BaseForm`` constructor has been
         called on the form instance that's being constructed.

         This is important to note when you intend to dynamically modify
         ``fields`` when extending a form -- you must call the constructor of
         the form which has been extended before attempting to modify
         ``fields``.

      :type: Object with field names as property names and Field instances as properties.

   .. js:attribute:: form.isInitialRender

      Determines if this form has been given input data which can be validated.

      ``true`` if the form has ``data`` or ``files`` set.

   .. js:attribute:: form.cleanedData

      After a form has been validated, it will have a ``cleanedData`` property.
      If your data does *not* validate, ``cleanedData`` will contain only the
      valid fields.

      :type:
         Object with field names as property names and valid, cleaned values
         coerced to the appropriate JavaScript type as properties.

   **Prototype Functions**

   Prototype functions for validating and getting information about the results
   of validation:

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#validate(form)

      Gets input data from the ``<form>`` containing this Form's rendered widgets
      and validates it.

      :param form:
        a ``<form>`` DOM node -- if React's representation of the ``<form>``
        is given, its ``getDOMNode()`` function will be called to get the real
        DOM node.

      :return:
         ``true`` if the <form> data is valid, ``false`` otherwise.

      .. versionadded:: 0.6

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#reset([initialData])

      Resets the form to its initial render state, optionally giving it new
      initial data.

      :param Object initialData:
         new initial data for the form.

      .. versionadded:: 0.6

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#setData(data[, kwargs])

      Replaces the form's :js:attr:`form.data` with the given data (and flips
      :js:attr:`form.isInitialRender` to ``false``, if necessary) and triggers
      form cleaning and validation, returning the result of ``form.isValid()``.

      :param Object data: new input data for the form

      :param Object kwargs: data updating options, which are as follows:

      :param Boolean kwargs.prefixed:
         pass ``true`` when updating data in a prefixed form and the field
         names in ``data`` are already prefixed -- defaults to ``false``

         .. versionadded:: 0.6

      :return:
         ``true`` if the form has no errors after validating the updated data,
         ``false`` otherwise.

      .. versionadded:: 0.5

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#setFormData(formData)

      Replaces with form's input data with data extracted from a ``<form>`` (i.e.
      with :js:func:`formData`).

      When using multiple forms with prefixes, form data will always be prefixed -
      using this method when working with manually extracting form data should
      ensure there are no surprises if moving from non-prefixed forms to prefixed
      forms.

      :param Object formData:
         new input data for the form, which has been extracted from a ``<form>``

       .. versionadded:: 0.6

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#updateData(data[, kwargs])

      Updates the form's :js:attr:`form.data` (and flips
      :js:attr:`form.isInitialRender` to ``false``, if necessary).

      By default, triggers validation of fields which had their input data
      updated, as well as form-wide cleaning.

      :param Object data:
         partial input data for the form, field name -> input data.

         If your form has a :ref:`prefix <ref-form-prefixes>`, field names in
         the given data object must also be prefixed.

      :param Object kwargs: data updating options, which are as follows:

      :param Boolean kwargs.prefixed:
         pass ``true`` when updating data in a prefixed form and the field
         names in ``data`` are already prefixed -- defaults to ``false``

      The follwing options are intended for use with controlled forms, when
      you're only updating data in order to change what's displayed in the
      controlled components:

      :param Boolean kwargs.validate:
         pass ``false`` if you want to skip validating the  updated fields --
         defaults to ``true``. This can be ignored if you're passing known-good
         data.

      :param Boolean kwargs.clearValidation:
         pass ``false`` if you're skipping validation and you also want to skip
         clearing of the results of any previous validation on the fields being
         updated, such as error messages and ``cleanedData`` -- defaults to
         ``true``

      .. versionadded:: 0.6

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#isComplete()

      Determines whether or not the form has errors and valid input data for all
      required fields, triggering cleaning of the form first if necessary.

      This can be used to indicate to the user that a form which is being
      validated as they fill it in is ready for submission.

      The distinction between ``isComplete()`` and :js:func:`BaseForm#isValid()`
      is that a form which has had, for example, a single field filled in and
      validated is valid according to the partial validation which has been
      performed so far (i.e. it doesn't have any error messages) but isn't yet
      complete.

      :return:
         ``true`` if the form has input data and has no errors, and there is
         cleanedData present for every required field on the form.

      .. versionadded:: 0.6

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#isValid()

      Determines whether or not the form has errors, triggering cleaning of the
      form first if necessary.

      When user input is being incrementally validated as it's given, this
      function gives you the current state of validation (i.e. whether or not
      there are any errors). It will not reflect the validity of the whole form
      until a method which performs whole-form validation (:js:func:`BaseForm#validate` or :js:func:`setData`) has been called.

      :return:
         ``true`` if the form is has input data and has no errors, ``false``
         otherwise. If errors are being ignored, returns ``false``.

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#errors()

      Getter for validation errors which first cleans the form if there are no
      errors defined yet.

      :returns: validation errors for the form, as an :js:class:`ErrorObject`

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#nonFieldErrors()

      :returns:
         errors that aren't associated with a particular field - i.e., errors
         generated by :js:func:`BaseForm#clean`, or by calling
         :js:func:`BaseForm#addError` and passing ``null`` instead of a field
         name. Will be an empty error list object if there are none.

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#hasChanged()

      :returns: ``true`` if data differs from initial, ``false`` otherwise.

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#changedData()

      :returns:
         a list of the names of fields which have differences between their
         initial and currently bound values.

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#fullClean()

      Validates and cleans ``forms.data`` and populates errors and ``cleanedData``.

      You shouldn't need to call this function directly in general use, as it's
      called for you when necessary by :js:func:`BaseForm#isValid` and
      :js:func:`BaseForm#errors`.

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#partialClean(fieldNames)

      Validates and cleans ``form.data`` for the given field names and triggers
      cross-form cleaning in case any ``form.cleanedData`` it uses has changed.

      :param Array fieldNames: a list of unprefixed field names.

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#clean()

      Hook for doing any extra form-wide cleaning after each Field's
      :js:func:`Field#clean` has been called. Any :js:class:`ValidationError`
      thrown by this method will not be associated with a particular field; it
      will have a special-case association with the field named ``'__all__'``.

      If you override this method and return something from it, the returned
      value will be used as the new ``cleanedData``.

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#addError(field, error)

      This function allows adding errors to specific fields from within the
      ``form.clean()`` method, or from outside the form altogether. This is a
      better alternative to fiddling directly with ``form._errors``, which we
      shouldn't even be *mentioning* in here, whoops...

      The ``field`` argument is the name of the field to which the errors should
      be added. If its value is ``null`` the error will be treated as a
      non-field error as returned by ``form.nonFieldErrors()``.

      The ``error`` argument can be a simple string, or preferably an instance
      of :js:class:`ValidationError`.

      Note that ``form.addError()`` automatically removes the relevant field
      from :js:attr:`form.cleanedData`.

      .. versionadded:: 0.5

   A number of default rendering functions are provided to generate
   ``React.DOM`` representations of a Form's fields.

   These are general-purpose in that they attempt to handle all form rendering
   scenarios and edge cases, ensuring that valid markup is always produced.

   For flexibility, the output does not include a ``<form>`` or a submit
   button, just field labels and inputs.

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#render()

      Default rendering method, which calls :js:func:`BaseForm#asTable`

      .. versionadded:: 0.5

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#asTable()

      Renders the form as a series of ``<tr>`` tags, with ``<th>`` and ``<td>``
      tags containing field labels and inputs, respectively.

      You're responsible for ensuring the generated rows are placed in a
      containing ``<table>`` and ``<tbody>``.

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#asUl()

      Renders the form as a series of ``<li>`` tags, with each ``<li>``
      containing one field. It does not include the ``<ul>`` so that you can
      specify any HTML attributes on the ``<ul>`` for flexibility.

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#asDiv()

      Renders the form as a series of ``<div>`` tags, with each ``<div>``
      containing one field.

      .. versionadded:: 0.5

   Prototype functions for use in rendering form fields.

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#boundFields([test])

      Creates a :js:class:`BoundField` for each field in the form, in the order
      in which the fields were created.

      :param Function(field,name) test:

         If provided, this function will be called with ``field`` and ``name``
         arguments - BoundFields will only be generated for fields for which
         ``true`` is returned.

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#boundFieldsObj([test])

      A version of :js:func:`BaseForm#boundFields` which returns an Object with
      field names as property names and BoundFields as properties.

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#boundField(name)

      Creates a :js:class:`BoundField` for the field with the given name.

      :param String name: the name of a field in the form.

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#hiddenFields()

      :returns: a list of :js:class:`BoundField` objects that correspond to
         hidden fields. Useful for manual form layout.

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#visibleFields()

      :returns:
         a list of :js:class:`BoundField` objects that do not correspond to
         hidden fields. The opposite of the :js:func:`BaseForm#hiddenFields`
         function.

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#isMultipart()

      Determines if the form needs to be multipart-encoded in other words, if it
      has a :js:class:`FileInput`.

      :returns: ``true`` if the form needs to be multipart-encoded.

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#addPrefix(fieldName)

      :returns:
         the given field name with a prefix added, if this Form has a prefix.

   .. js:function:: BaseForm#addInitialPrefix(fieldName)

      Adds an initial prefix for checking dynamic initial values.

.. _ref-api-boundfield:

``BoundField``
==============

.. js:class:: BoundField(form, field, name)

   A field and its associated data.

   This is the primary means of generating components such as labels and input
   fields in the default form rendering methods.

   Its attributes and methods will be of particular use when implementing custom
   form layout and rndering.

   :param Form form:
      a form.

   :param Field field:
      one of the form's fields.

   :param String name:
      the name the field is given by the form.

   **Instance Attributes**

   .. js:attribute:: boundField.form

      The form this BoundField wraps a field from.

      :type: Form

   .. js:attribute:: boundField.field

      The field this BoundField wraps.

      :type: Field

   .. js:attribute:: boundField.name

      The name associated with the field in the form.

      :type: String

   .. js:attribute:: boundField.htmlName

      A version of the field's name including any prefix the form has been
      configured with.

      Assuming your forms are configured with prefixes when needed, this
      should be a unique identifier for any particular field (e.g. if you need
      something to pass as a ``key`` prop to a React component).

      :type: String

   .. js:attribute:: boundField.label

      The label the field is configured with, or a label automatically generated
      from the field's name.

      :type: String

   .. js:attribute:: boundField.helpText

      Help text the field is configured with, othewise an empty string.

      :type: String

   **Prototype Functions**

   .. js:function:: BoundField#errors()

      :returns:
         validation errors for the field - if there were none, an empty error
         list object will be returned.

      :type: :js:class:`ErrorList` (by default, but configurable via :js:class:`BaseForm` ``kwargs.errorConstructor``)

   .. js:function:: BoundField#errorMessage()

      Convenience method for getting the first error message for the field, as
      a single error message is the most common error scenario for a field.

      :returns:
         the first validation error message for the field - if there were none,
         returns undefined.

   .. js:function:: BoundField#errorMessages()

      :returns:
         all validation error messages for the field - if there were none,
         returns an empty list.

   .. js:function:: BoundField#isHidden()

      :returns: ``true`` if the field is configured with a hidden widget.

   .. js:function:: BoundField#autoId()

      Calculates and returns the ``id`` attribute for this BoundField if the
      associated form has an ``autoId`` set, or set to ``true``. Returns an
      empty string otherwise.

   .. js:function:: BoundField#data()

      :returns: Raw input data for the field or ``null`` if it wasn't given.

   .. js:function:: BoundField#idForLabel()

      Wrapper around the field widget's :js:func:`Widget#idForLabel`. Useful,
      for example, for focusing on this field regardless of whether it has a
      single widget or a :js:class:`MutiWidget`.

   .. js:function:: BoundField#render([kwargs])

      Default rendering method - if the field has ``showHiddenInitial`` set,
      renders the default widget and a hidden version, otherwise just renders
      the default widget for the field.

      :param Object kwargs: widget options as per :js:func:`BoundField#asWidget`.

   .. js:function:: BoundField#asWidget([kwargs])

      Renders a widget for the field.

      :param Object kwargs: widget options, which are as follows:

      :param Widget kwargs.widget:
         an override for the widget used to render the field - if not
         provided, the field's configured widget will be used.

      :param Object kwargs.attrs:
         additional HTML attributes to be added to the field's widget.

   .. js:function:: BoundField#subWidgets()

      :returns:
         a list of :js:class:`SubWidget` objects that comprise all widgets in
         this BoundField. This really is only useful for :js:class:`RadioSelect`
         and :js:class:`CheckboxSelectMultiple` widgets, so that you can iterate
         over individual inputs when rendering.

   .. js:function:: BoundField#asText([kwargs])

      Renders the field as a text input.

      :param Object kwargs: widget options, which are as follows:

      :param Object kwargs.attrs:
         additional HTML attributes to be added to the field's widget.

   .. js:function:: BoundField#asTextarea([kwargs])

      Renders the field as a textarea.

      :param Object kwargs: widget options, which are as follows:

      :param Object kwargs.attrs:
         additional HTML attributes to be added to the field's widget.

   .. js:function:: BoundField#asHidden([kwargs])

      Renders the field as a hidden field.

      :param Object kwargs: widget options, which are as follows

      :param Object kwargs.attrs:
         additional HTML attributes to be added to the field's widget.

   .. js:function:: BoundField#value()

      Returns the raw value to display for this BoundField, using data if the
      form is bound, or the initial value otherwise

   .. js:function:: BoundField#labelTag([kwargs])

      Creates a ``<label>`` for the field if it has an ``id`` attribute,
      otherwise generates a text label.

      :param Object kwargs: label customisation options, which are as follows:

      :param String kwargs.contents:
         custom contents for the label -- if not provided, label contents will
         be generated from the field itself.

      :param Object kwargs.attrs:
         additional HTML attributes to be added to the label tag.

      :param String kwargs.labelSuffix:
         a custom suffix for the label.

   .. js:function:: BoundField#cssClasses([extraClasses])

      Returns a string of space-separated CSS classes to be applied to the
      field.

      :param String extraClasses:
         additional CSS classes to be applied to the field
