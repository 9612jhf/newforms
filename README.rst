js-forms
========

A JavaScript port of `Django`_'s `form-handling library`_, which runs in
browsers (tested in the latest Firefox, Chrome and Opera browsers... and
IE 6-8) and CommonJS environments (only tested with `Node.js`_).

Dependencies
------------

* `DOMBuilder`_ is required for interchangeable DOM Element / HTML
  generation.

  For Node.js, clone the DOMBuilder repository and add its path to your
  NODE_PATH environment variable, as the js-forms distribution module will
  attempt to ``require('DOMBuilder')``.

Basic Usage
-----------

As direct porting from Django is nearing completion, the resulting API is
very much focused on the server side. As such, Node.js is probably the
best place to use js-forms in anger at the moment, as you'll be working
with a request/response cycle, which is Django forms' usual mode of
operation.

Client side features, such as hooking into the DOM for instant validation
and feedback, will be the focus of future work.

In lieu of documentation and an official distribution build - which will
be forthcoming - here's a quick guide to getting started with js-forms.

* Run ``build/build.py`` to generate a single ``js-forms.js``
  distribution file, which assembles the component source files and
  defines a ``forms`` namespace object.

  The API exposed by this object is defined in ``build/formsnamespace.js``.

  For Node.js, add the path to your checkout of js-forms to your NODE_PATH
  to be able to import it with ``require('js-forms')``. If you install
  `express`_ and `jade`_ via `npm`_ (Node Package Manager), you can run
  ``node demo.js`` to see a basic example of js-forms in action.

  .. _`jade`: http://jade-lang.com/
  .. _`npm`: http://npmjs.org/

* Form constructors are created using the ``form.Forms`` factory function,
  which takes a single ``Object`` argument defining form fields and any
  other properties for the prorotype (validation methods etc.), returning
  a Form constructor which inherits from ``BaseForm``::

     var ContactForm = forms.Form({
       subject: new forms.CharField({maxLength: 100}),
       message: new forms.CharField(),
       sender: new forms.EmailField(),
       ccMyself: new forms.BooleanField({required: false})
     });

     var form = new ContactForm();

* FormSet constructors are created using the ``form.FormSet`` factory
  function, which takes a Form constructor and any additional properties
  for the FormSet defined as an ``Object``, returning a FormSet constructor
  which inherits from ``BaseFormSet``::

     var ArticleForm = forms.Form({
       title: new forms.CharField(),
       pubDate: new forms.DateField()
     });

     var ArticleFormSet = forms.FormSet(ArticleForm, {extra: 1});

     var formSet = new ArticleFormSet();

* The API is largely consistent with Django's API, with the following
  rules of thumb for converting between the two:

  * Where Django accepts keyword arguments, in Javascript a single
    ``Object`` argument is expected, with arguments expressed as its
    properties.

    Note that this applies *anywhere* Django accepts a keyword argument,
    even if the convention in Django is to  pass certain keyword arguments
    positionally, e.g. when passing in POST data to a Form constructor.

    *Django (by convention)*::

       f = MyForm(request.POST)

    *Javascript*::

       var f = new MyForm({data: req.body});

  * Method and variable names which used ``underscores_in_python`` become
    ``camelCasedInJavaScript``.

  * Don't forget the ``new`` operator!

    *Django*::

       forms.CharField(max_length=100)

    *JavaScript*::

       new forms.CharField({maxLength: 100})

  * Due to limited cross-browser support for properties in JavaScript,
    Form and FormSet properties such as ``cleaned_data`` and ``errors``
    become method calls; e.g. ``cleanedData()`` and ``errors()``.

    It's ugly, but it works everywhere.

  * Objects which would be coerced to a string for display in Django,
    such as Forms, FormSets and ErrorLists, have a ``defaultRendering()``
    method.

    This is required because js-forms can output DOM Elements or HTML
    from the same objects and there's no standard ``toDOM()``-type method
    in JavaScript. If you're operating in HTML mode, you can coerce these
    objects to string to get HTML out of them, as their ``toString()``
    methods make use of ``defaultRendering()``.

The unit tests exercise the library thoroughly, so dip in for examples of
further usage in the meantime.
