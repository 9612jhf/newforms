An isomorphic JavaScript form-handling library for `React`_.

(Old `Django`_ hands may recognise "newforms" as the former name of its
`form-handling library`_ - newforms started out as a direct port of
``django.forms`` to JavaScript)

Getting newforms
================

Browser bundles
   Browser bundles include all dependencies except React.

   They expose newforms as a global ``forms`` variable and expect to find a
   global ``React`` variable to work with.

   Release bundles will be available from:

      * https://github.com/insin/newforms/tree/react/dist

   **v0.5.1** / 2014-04-01 -- `View CHANGES`_

      * `newforms-0.5.1.js`_
      * `newforms-0.5.1.min.js`_

   Development bundles (updated intermittently):

      * `newforms.js`_
      * `newforms.min.js`_

Node.js
   ::

      npm install newforms

   .. code-block:: javascript

      var forms = require('newforms')

.. _`newforms-0.5.1.js`: https://github.com/insin/newforms/raw/react/dist/newforms-0.5.1.js
.. _`newforms-0.5.1.min.js`: https://github.com/insin/newforms/raw/react/dist/newforms-0.5.1.min.js

Quick Guide
===========

* Form constructors are created using ``forms.Form.extend()``.

  This takes an ``Object`` argument defining form fields and any other
  properties for the form's prototype (custom validation functions etc.),
  returning a Form constructor which inherits from ``BaseForm``::

     var ContactForm = forms.Form.extend({
       subject  : forms.CharField({maxLength: 100})
     , message  : forms.CharField()
     , sender   : forms.EmailField()
     , ccMyself : forms.BooleanField({required: false})

     // Implement custom validation for a field by adding a clean<FieldName>()
     // function to the form's prototype.
     , cleanSender: function() {
         if (this.cleanedData.sender == 'mymatesteve@gmail.com') {
            throw forms.ValidationError("I know it's you, Steve. " +
                                        "Stop messing with my example form.")
         }
       }

     // Implement custom whole-form validation by adding a clean() function to
     // the form's prototype
     , clean: function() {
         if (this.cleanedData.subject.indexOf('that tenner you owe me') != -1 &&
             PEOPLE_I_OWE_A_TENNER_TO.indexOf(this.cleanedData.sender) != 1) {
           // This error will be associated with the named field
           this.addError('sender', "Your email address doesn't seem to be working.")
           // This error will be associated with the form itself, to be
           // displayed independently.
           throw forms.ValidationError('*BZZZT!* SYSTEM ERROR. Beeepity-boop etc. etc.')
         }
       }
     })

* For convenience and compactness, the ``new`` operator is **optional** when
  using newforms' Fields, Widgets and other constructors which are commonly
  used while defining a Form, such as ValidationError -- however ``new`` is
  **not**  automatically optional for the Form and FormSet constructors you
  create::

     var form = new ContactForm()

* Forms have default convenience rendering methods to get you started quickly,
  which display a label, input widgets and any validation errors for each field
  (however, JSX and ``React.DOM`` make it convenient to write your own custom
  rendering later)::

     <form ref="contactForm" onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
       <table>
         <tbody>
           {this.state.form.asTable()}
         </tbody>
       </table>
       <div className="controls">
         <input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
       </div>
     </form>

* To bind a form to user data to be validated and cleaned, pass a ``data``
  object when creating it, or call the ``setData()`` method of an existing
  form to bind new data to it.

  For example, if the form was held as state in a React component which
  had the above JSX in its ``render()`` method::

     function onSubmit(e) {
       e.preventDefault()

       var form = this.state.form
       var formData = forms.formData(this.refs.contactForm.getDOMNode())
       var isValid = form.setData(formData)

       if (isValid) {
         // form.cleanedData now contains validated input data, coerced to the
         // appropriate JavaScript data types by its Fields.
       }
       else {
         // If the data was invalid, the forms's error object will be populated
         // with field validation errors, which will be displayed the next time
         // it's rendered.
         this.forceUpdate()
       }
     }
