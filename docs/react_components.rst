``RenderForm``
==============

This component handles rendering a Form as a list of "rows". Each field in the
form gets its own row, while other rows are rendered as necessary (e.g.
displaying whole-form errors on top).

It can also take care of some of the details of creating a Form instance and
re-rendering when the form's state changes for you.

.. code-block:: html

   <RenderForm form={MyForm} ref="myForm"/>

``RenderForm`` handles the generic use case for form rendering:

* Whole-form error messages are displayed at the top.
* Each visible field in the form is displayed in the order fields were defined.

Form options
------------

Any props passed to ``RenderForm`` which aren't listed below will be passed to
the Form constructror when creating an instance. This allows you to pass all the
usual :js:class:`form options <BaseForm>` directly to the component.

For example, if you need to display more than one of the same Form, you need to
specify a prefix to give them a unique namespace:

.. code-block:: html

   <fieldset>
     <legend>Parent 1</legend>
     <RenderForm form={ParentForm} prefix="parent1"/>
   </fieldset>
   <fieldset>
     <legend>Parent 2</legend>
     <RenderForm form={ParentForm} prefix="parent2"/>
   </fieldset>

.. raw:: html

   <iframe src="_static/html/renderform-form-props.html"
           style="box-sizing: border-box; width: 100%; overflow: hidden; border: 0">
   </iframe>

Other rendering scenarios
-------------------------

``RenderForm`` also handles some less common scenarios:

* Displaying error messages related to hidden fields.
* Rendering hidden fields.
* Displaying a progress indicator if the form has asynchronous whole-form
  validation pending completion.

Props
-----

``RenderForm`` expects the following prop arguments:

.. Note::
   A ``ReactCompositeComponent`` is what you get back when you call
   ``React.createClass()``

``className``
   :type: ``String``

   If provided, this prop will be passed to the wrapper component containing all
   the form's rows.

``component``
   :type: ``ReactCompositeComponent`` or ``String`` (an HTML tag name)

   The component used to wrap all the form's rows. Defaults to ``'div'``.

``form``
   :type: ``Form`` or ``Function`` (a Form constructor)

   The Form to be rendered -- can be a constructor or an instance.

   If you pass a Form constructor, the component will instantiate it for you. Any
   additional props you pass to ``RenderForm`` will be passed as options when
   creating the form instance.

   You can also pass a Form instance. When doing so, make sure you set up the
   instance's :ref:`onChange() <ref-form-state-onchange>` in such a way that it
   will re-render the ``<RenderForm/>`` when the form changes.

``row``
   :type: ``ReactCompositeComponent``

   The component used to render each form row. Defaults to
   :ref:`FormRow <ref-components-formrow>`.

``rowComponent``
   :type: ``ReactCompositeComponent`` or ``String`` (an HTML tag name)

   The component used to wrap each row. Defaults to ``'div'``.

   This is passed as a ``component`` prop to the component in the ``row`` prop.

.. _ref-components-formrow:

``FormRow``
===========

This component handles rendering a single form "row". ``RenderForm`` uses this
to render rows by default; it will either:

1. Wrap some given content as a row, or:
2. Use a field's :ref:`rendering helper <ref-custom-display-boundfield>` to
   generate a row for the field, with a label, user input, error messages and
   help text, as necessary.

Props
-----

``FormRow`` expects the following props:

``content``
   :type: Any

   If given, will be used for the entire contents of the row.

``bf``
   :type: :js:class:`BoundField`

   If given and ``content`` is not given, this Field rendering helper will be
   used to create contents for a Field row.

``component``
   :type: ``ReactCompositeComponent`` or ``String`` (an HTML tag name)

   The component used to wrap the row contents. Defaults to ``'div'``.

``className``
   :type: String

   If provided, this prop will be passed to the wrapper component for the row.

``hidden``
   :type: Boolean

   If ``true``, the row container ReactElement will be given a ``display: none``
   style -- defaults to ``false``.

``RenderFormset``
