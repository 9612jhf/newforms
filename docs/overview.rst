Overview

Newforms takes care of a number of common form-related tasks. Using it, you can:

   * Display a form with automatically generated form widgets.
   * Check user input data against a set of validation rules.
   * Redisplay a form in the case of validation errors.
   * Convert submitted form data to the relevant JavaScript data types.

Concepts
========

The core concepts newforms deals with are:

Widgets
   Widgets correspond to HTML form inputs -- they hold metadata required to
   display an input (or inputs) and given a field's name and user input data,
   will create ``React.DOM`` components which can be rendered to a browser's DOM
   or to a string of HTML.

   For example, a ``Select`` knows which ``<option>`` values and labels it
   should generate and how to generate a ``<select>`` with the option
   corresponding to given user input data marked as selected.

Fields
   A Field holds metadata about a piece of user input. This metadata is the
   source for:

   * Arranging display of suitable HTML form inputs for entering and editing
     the expected input.
   * Validating the user input and providing an appropriate error message when
     it's invalid.
   * Converting valid user input to an appropriate JavaScript data type.

   For example, an ``IntegerField`` makes sure that its user input data is a
   valid integer, is valid according to any additional rules defined in its
   metadata -- such as ``minValue`` -- and converts valid user input to a
   JavaScript ``Number``.

Forms
   Forms group related Fields together and are responsible for giving them
   unique names. They use their fields to validate user input data, and manage
   displaying them as HTML.

   Forms drive the validation process, holding raw user input data, validation
   error messages and "cleaned" data which has been validated and
   type-converted.

Form objects
============

Form constructors are created by extending ``forms.Form`` and declaratively
specifying field names and metadata:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var ContactForm = forms.Form.extend({
     subject: forms.CharField({maxLength: 100})
   , message: forms.CharField()
   , sender: forms.EmailField()
   , ccMyself: forms.BooleanField({required: false})
   })

A form is composed of ``Field`` objects. In this case, our form has four
fields: ``subject``, ``message``, ``sender`` and ``ccMyself``. ``CharField``,
``EmailField`` and ``BooleanField`` are just three of the available field types
-- a full list can be found in :doc:`fields`.

Whether or not a form is given :ref:`ref-form-initial-input-data` is important:

* A form with no input data will render as empty or will contain default values.

* If a form is given input data, it can validate it. If a form is rendered with
  invalid input data, it can include inline error messages telling the user what
  data to correct.

Processing input data with a Form
---------------------------------

When a form is given valid input data, the successfully validated form data will
be in the ``form.cleanedData`` object. This data will have been converted into
JavaScript types for you, where necessary.

In the above example, ``ccMyself`` will be a boolean value. Likewise, fields
such as ``IntegerField`` and ``DateField`` convert values to a JavaScript
``Number`` and ``Date``, respectively.

Displaying a Form
-----------------

Rather than newforms providing its own custom React components, ``Form`` objects
render to ``React.DOM`` components, to be included in the ``render()`` output of
the React component the form is being used in.

A form also only outputs its own fields; it's up to you to provide the
surrounding ``<form>`` element, submit buttons etc:

.. code-block:: javascript

   render: function() {
     return <form action="/contact" method="POST">
       {this.state.form.asDiv()}
       <div>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit"/><input type="button" value="Cancel"/>
       </div>
     </form>
   }

``form.asDiv()`` will output the form with each form field and accompanying
label wrapped in a ``<div>``. Here's the output for our example component:

.. code-block:: html

   <form action="/contact" method="POST">
     <div><label for="id_subject">Subject:</label> <input maxlength="100" type="text" name="subject" id="id_subject"></div>
     <div><label for="id_message">Message:</label> <input type="text" name="message" id="id_message"></div>
     <div><label for="id_sender">Sender:</label> <input type="email" name="sender" id="id_sender"></div>
     <div><label for="id_ccMyself">Cc myself:</label> <input type="checkbox" name="ccMyself" id="id_ccMyself"></div>
     <div><input type="submit" value="Submit"><input type="button" value="Cancel"></div>
   </form>

Note that each form field has an ``id`` attribute set to ``id_<field-name>``,
which is referenced by the accompanying label tag. You can
:ref:`customise the way in which labels and ids are generated <ref-forms-configuring-label>`.

You can also use ``form.asTable()`` to output table rows (you'll need to provide
your own ``<table>`` and ``<tbody>``) and ``form.asUl()`` to output list items.
Forms also have a default ``form.render()`` method which calls
``form.asTable()``.

Customising Form display
========================

The default generated HTML can help you get started quickly, but you can
completely customise the way a form is presented.

To assist with rendering, we introduce another concept which ties together
Widgets, Fields and Forms:

BoundField
   A :js:class:`BoundField` is a helper for rendering HTML content for -- and
   related to -- a single Field.

   It ties together the Field itself, the fields's configured Widget, the name
   the field is given by the Form, and the raw user input data and validation
   errors held by a Form.

   BoundFields provide properties and functions for using these together to
   render the different components required to display a field -- its label,
   form inputs and validation error messages -- as well as exposing the
   constituent parts of each of these should you wish to fully customise every
   aspect of form display.

Forms provide a number of methods for creating BoundFields. These are:

* ``form.boundFieldsObj()`` -- returns an object whose properties are the form's
  field names,  with BoundFields as values.
* ``form.boundFields()`` -- returns a list of BoundFields in their form-defined
  order.
* ``form.boundField(fieldName)`` -- returns the BoundField for the named field.

Every object which can generate ``React.DOM`` components in newforms has a
default ``render()`` method -- for BoundFields, the default ``render()`` for a
non-hidden field calls ``asWidget()``, which renders the Widget the field
is configured with.

A selection of the properties and methods of a BoundField which are useful for
custom field rendering are listed below. For complete details, see the
:ref:`BoundField API docs <ref-api-boundfield>`.

Useful BoundField properties:

``bf.field``
   The :js:class:`Field` instance from the form, that this :js:class:`BoundField`
   wraps. You can use it to access field properties directly.

   Newforms also adds a :ref:`custom property <ref-fields-field-custom>` to the
   Field API -- you can pass this argument when creating a field to store any
   additional, custom metadata you want to associate with the field for later
   use.

``bf.helpText``
   Any help text that has been associated with the field.

``bf.label``
   The label text for the field, e.g. ``'Email address'``.

``bf.name``
   The name of the field in the form.

Useful BoundField methods:

``bf.errors()``
   Gets an object which holds any validation error messages for the field and
   has a default rendering to a ``<ul class="errorlist">``.

``bf.errorMessage()``
   Gets the first validation error message for the field as a String, or
   ``undefined`` if there are none, making it convenient for conditional display
   of error messages.

``bf.idForLabel()``
   Generates the id that will be used for this field. You may want to use this
   in lieu of ``labelTag()`` if you are constructing the label manually.

``bf.labelTag()``
   Generates a a ``<label>`` containing the field's label text.

``bf.value()``
   Gets the value to be displayed in the field.

Using these, let's customise rendering of our ContactForm. Rendering things in
React is just a case of creating ``React.DOM`` components, so the full power of
JavaScript and, should you need them, custom React components are available to you.

For example, let's customise rendering to add a CSS class to our form field rows
and to put the checkbox for the ``ccMyself`` field inside its ``<label>``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   function renderField(bf) {
     var className = 'form-field'
     if (bf.field instanceof forms.BooleanField) {
       return <div className={className}>
         <label>{bf.render()} {bf.label}</label> {bf.errorMessage()}
       </div>
     }
     else {
       return <div className={className}>
         {bf.labelTag()} {bf.render()} {bf.errorMessage()}
       </div>
     }
   }

We still don't need to do much work in our component's ``render()`` method:

.. code-block:: javascript

   render: function() {
     return <form action="/contact" method="POST">
       {this.state.form.boundFields.map(renderField)}
       <div>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit"/><input type="button" value="Cancel"/>
       </div>
     </form>
   }

Its initial rendered output is now:

.. code-block:: html

   <form action="/contact" method="POST">
     <div class="form-field"><label for="id_subject">Subject:</label> <input maxlength="100" type="text" name="subject" id="id_subject"></div>
     <div class="form-field"><label for="id_message">Message:</label> <input type="text" name="message" id="id_message"></div>
     <div class="form-field"><label for="id_sender">Sender:</label> <input type="email" name="sender" id="id_sender"></div>
     <div class="form-field"><label for="id_ccMyself"><input type="checkbox" name="ccMyself" id="id_ccMyself"> Cc myself</label></div>
     <div><input type="submit" value="Submit"><input type="button" value="Cancel"></div>
   </form>
